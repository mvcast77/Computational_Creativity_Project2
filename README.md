## How to setup the Virtual environment we're working with

Assuming you've setup a virtual environment for this project, we can now do the following.

To do initial setup, run

	pip install -r requirements.txt

This will get all the packages needed to run the project consistently.

If you've run 

	pip install <new_package>

then we have new requirements to add in. Run the following:

	pip freeze > requirements.txt

to update the requirements so everything works on everyone's machine.
